training: We offer a comprehensive Drilling Mechanics and Continuous Improvement training plan. With 16 modules,
  each session is approximately 90 minutes most include pre & post quizzes, and time for open discussion. References
  are given for additional study.

  When classes can be delivered in person in the US content retention is much better. This can be 3 full days, or
  6 half days, as required to accommodate work schedules.

  For remote training, we suggest two 90 minute video calls per week with cameras turned on to gauge the student's
  engagement and comprehension of the material. Students can read the references as pre-work to help maintain
  their regular business activities.

consulting: This content can be customized based on your company's needs and incorporated into dedicated
  workshops focused on your most relevant issues and opportunities. We also consult on a wide range of
  drilling issues and can coordinate with other Subject Matter Experts for additional topics and support.

challenges: Below are a few of the open industry challenges that have a significant impact on drilling performance.
  If you are a service company, industry consultant, or academic interested in working together on one of these
  challenges give us a call.
